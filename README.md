 futa: A (Functionally) Useless Terminal Assistant - powered by AI!

💩 Are you tired of knowing what you're doing in the terminal? Want to add ✨chaos✨ to your workflow?
🧠 Introducing: futa — the Functionally Useless Terminal Assistant that runs a MASSIVE 🤯 LANGUAGE MODEL 🧠 to execute the tiniest of commands for you!
Because why just type ls when you can launch a rocket 🚀 of AI processing to tell you to type ls? 🤷‍♂️💸

🛠️ How It Works
bash
Copy
Edit
futa <command>
You type literally anything 🤌

FUTA spins up a large language model 📚 (yes, every time)

It interprets your command with the intelligence of a thousand neckbeards 🧔‍♂️🧔‍♀️🧔

Then it decides what to actually run in your terminal 🧪

It might do what you want. It might destroy your file system. 🤡 Who knows!

💡 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
futa "make it go brrr"
🧠🤔 LLM: Analyzing command...
🔍 "make it go brrr" detected as 'start a Docker container probably?'
⚙️ Executing: docker-compose up --force-recreate --brrr-mode=true
💥💥💥💥💥💥

📦 Features
🤖 Uses more compute power than the Apollo missions to run git status

🎭 Responds with overconfident energy, even when it’s dead wrong

💫 Random Easter eggs because why not

🧵 Outputs at least 3 paragraphs of explanation before running a 1-line command

📉 Productivity? Never heard of her

🧨 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install futa  # or don't. You probably shouldn't.
